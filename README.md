# Model Architecture
The Vision Transformer (ViT) model architecture is based on the transformer architecture, which has been highly successful in natural language processing tasks. The primary idea behind ViT is to process images as sequences of fixed-size non-overlapping patches, and then leverage the transformer's self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies and long-range relationships among these patches.

# Patch Embeddings
The input image is divided into small fixed-size non-overlapping patches. Each patch is then linearly embedded into a lower-dimensional space, typically referred to as the "embedding dimension." These embeddings are flattened to create a sequence of tokens, where each token corresponds to one image patch. The embeddings capture local visual information and serve as the input for the transformer encoder.

# Positional Embeddings
To provide positional information to the transformer, positional embeddings are added to the patch embeddings. These positional embeddings are learnable vectors that represent the spatial location of each patch in the image. They enable the model to differentiate between different patches based on their relative positions, as the transformer lacks any inherent notion of spatial relationships.

# Transformer Encoder
The core component of the Vision Transformer model is the transformer encoder. It consists of multiple transformer layers stacked on top of each other. Each transformer layer contains a self-attention mechanism and feed-forward neural networks.

# Self-Attention: Self-attention is the key mechanism that allows the model to capture global dependencies and attend to relevant patches in the image. It enables each patch embedding to attend to all other patches in the sequence, learning meaningful relationships among them. This attention mechanism helps the model understand the context of each patch within the entire image.

# Feed-Forward Neural Networks: After self-attention, the transformer encoder applies feed-forward neural networks to each patch's embeddings independently. This step allows the model to perform non-linear transformations and capture more complex patterns in the data.

# Classification Head
At the end of the transformer encoder, a classification head is attached to the final encoder layer. The classification head is a fully connected layer that maps the representations obtained from the transformer encoder to the number of classes in the dataset. During training, the model optimizes its parameters to minimize the cross-entropy loss between predicted class probabilities and ground-truth labels.
